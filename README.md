## Features
- Fetches quiz questions in real-time from the **Open Trivia API**.
- UI components include progress bars and charts, implemented with **react-circular-progressbar** and **react-chartjs-2**.
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.
- Built for performance with optimized production build.
